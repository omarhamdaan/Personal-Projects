# Machine Learning Project Repository

This repository contains various machine learning models and analyses performed on different datasets, including fashion items, diabetes mellitus prediction, and more. The models range from simple linear regression to more complex deep learning approaches.

## Projects and Files

### Notebooks

- **Classification on FashionMinist_ ANN_CNN.ipynb**
  - This notebook explores both Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for classifying fashion items from the FashionMNIST dataset.

- **Diabetes_Mellitus_Prediction_DeepLearning Approach.ipynb**
  - Deep learning models to predict the onset of diabetes mellitus.

- **Diabetes_Mellitus_Prediction_SVM Approach.ipynb**
  - Utilizes Support Vector Machines (SVM) to predict diabetes mellitus.

- **Linear Regression.ipynb**
  - A simple linear regression model to understand the relationships in a smaller dataset.

- **SVM_Parameter_Optimization.ipynb**
  - Optimizes SVM parameters to enhance model predictions.
